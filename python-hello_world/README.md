# Python - Hello, World

This project is an introduction to Python programming, covering the basics of printing, string manipulation, and Python's philosophy.

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python
- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name Python come from
- What is the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.x
- All files are executable
- Code follows PEP8 style guide
- All files end with a new line
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Files

### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `2-print.py` | Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" |
| `3-print_number.py` | Prints the integer stored in the variable number, followed by "Battery street" |
| `4-print_float.py` | Prints the float stored in the variable number with 2 decimal places |
| `5-print_string.py` | Prints a string 3 times, then its first 9 characters |
| `6-concat.py` | Concatenates two strings |
| `7-edges.py` | Extracts specific parts of a string (edges) |
| `8-concat_edges.py` | Creates a new sentence by extracting parts of a string |
| `9-easter_egg.py` | Prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters |

## Usage

Each file can be executed directly:

```bash
./2-print.py
./3-print_number.py
./4-print_float.py
./5-print_string.py
./6-concat.py
./7-edges.py
./8-concat_edges.py
./9-easter_egg.py
```

## The Zen of Python

Run `./9-easter_egg.py` or type `python3 -m this` to see the Zen of Python, a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python.
