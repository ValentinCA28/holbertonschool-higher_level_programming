===========================

This module defines a matrix division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

Importing the function from the module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Testing with a basic matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Testing with negative divisor:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -3))
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Testing with float divisor:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5))
    [[0.4, 0.8, 1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]

Testing with floats in matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.75, 1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75, 3.25]]

Testing with mixed integers and floats:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2.5, 3], [4.5, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.5, 1.25, 1.5], [2.25, 2.5, 3.0]]

Testing with single element matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[10]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    [[2.0]]

Testing with single row matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]]

Testing with single column matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1], [2], [3]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.5], [1.0], [1.5]]

Testing with large numbers:
    >>> matrix = [[1000, 2000], [3000, 4000]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 100))
    [[10.0, 20.0], [30.0, 40.0]]

Testing with zeros in matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]]

Testing that original matrix is not modified:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> new_matrix = matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    >>> print(matrix)
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
